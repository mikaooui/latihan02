   <h1>I burried you in the past, yet I still find myself at your grave.</h1> 
   <br>
   <br>
   <h4>I told myself it was over-that the final goodbye had been said, that the earth had swallowed what was left of you and of us. I laid our memories down like wilting flowers, one by one, thinking time would decay them into something unrecognizabe, something easier to forget. But some ghost do not rest.</h4>
   <br>
   <h4>Some wounds do not scab.</h4>
   <br>
   <h4>I left, yes. But not because I stop caring. I still check up on you-quietly, from afar, like a shadow that never quite fades. I needed to let go, not because it didn't matter, but because it mattered too much. I walked away for the freedom of us both, hoping you'd breathe easier without the weight of us dragging you down.</h4>
   <br>
   <h4>And yet, here I am again. Kneeling at the place where I thought I buried it all only to realize I never truly did. Because leaving doesn't mean I never loved you, never stayed up hoping you'd be okay. It only means I choose peace over pain, growth over grasping.</h4>
   <br>
   <h4>Graves are strange places. Not just for the dead, but for the love we had to put down before it turned cruel. And still, I find myself here-not to rekindle, not to reopen, but simply to remember. To care, quietly. Still.</h4>
