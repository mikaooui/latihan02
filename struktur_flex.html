            <h2>1. Historiographical Origins & Evolving Perspectives</h2>
            <p>The term "Dark Ages" was popularized in the 1330s by Francesco Petrarch, who viewed the period after the fall of Rome as culturally inferior compared to classical antiquity. In the 17th century, Cardinal Caesar Baronius referred to certain centuries as <i>saeculum obscurum</i> because of the scarcity of surviving written records. Modern historians, however, reject the label as misleading, emphasizing that the so-called Dark Ages were full of cultural, scientific, and intellectual developments. The term is now considered an outdated relic of Renaissance and Enlightenment bias.</p>

            <h2>2. Real Innovations & Intellectual Momentum</h2>
            <p>The Middle Ages saw flourishing scientific thought. Scholars like Johannes de Sacrobosco described Earth as a sphere, while universities founded by the Church nurtured studies in law, medicine, and astronomy. Islamic scholars contributed tools like the universal astrolabe and advanced algebra, while Byzantine thinkers preserved and expanded classical texts. Medical manuscripts show experimentation with treatments for migraines, childbirth, and more, challenging the notion that the period was purely superstitious.</p>

          <div class="article">
            <h2>3. Technological and Agricultural Advances</h2>
            <p>The medieval period witnessed transformative innovations: the heavy plow, horse collars, and three-field crop rotation revolutionized food production. Watermills, windmills, and paper mills advanced industry, while Gutenberg’s printing press—building on Chinese movable type—accelerated the spread of knowledge. Eyeglasses, advances in optics, and navigational tools further reshaped daily life and intellectual horizons.</p>

          <div class="article">
            <h2>4. Universities and Knowledge Transmission</h2>
            <p>Centers like Bologna, Paris, and Oxford did more than teach theology—they also expanded legal studies, mathematics, astronomy, and philosophy. These universities laid the foundation of the modern academic system. Knowledge from the Islamic world and Byzantine Empire enriched European thought, making the so-called Dark Ages a time of cross-cultural exchange rather than stagnation.</p>

            <h2>5. Reappraising the “Dark Ages” & Misuse of the Term</h2>
            <p>While once a common label, historians now avoid the term "Dark Ages." It oversimplifies the period and ignores its innovations. Unfortunately, popular culture and extremist ideologies often perpetuate myths of a barbaric, backward Europe. In reality, the Middle Ages laid the groundwork for the Renaissance and modern science, making the "darkness" a myth born of prejudice and lack of evidence rather than historical truth.</p>
